# typescript-learn

`src/index.ts` contains snippets of TypeScript code.  This file is meant to practice TypeScript syntax and also to see what kind of errors are generated by the TypeScript compiler when wrong types are used.

#### To run the compiler to transpile from TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
cd <project directory>
npx tsc
```

The transpiled JavaScript code will be under `build/`.

#### To run the project:
```bash
cd <project directory>
live-server
```
open src/index.html<br>
open your browser's dev tools to see console logs.
